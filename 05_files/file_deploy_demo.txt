The PS command

ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If
you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed
information, use top(1) instead.

This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:

1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can
appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally
identical, due to the many standards and ps implementations that this
ps is compatible with.

Note that "ps -aux" is distinct from "ps aux".  The POSIX and UNIX
standards require that "ps -aux" print all processes owned by a user
named "x", as well as printing all processes that would be selected by
the -a option.  If the user named "x" does not exist, this ps may
interpret the command as "ps aux" instead and print a warning.
